# mobile price classification
The goal of this project is to develop classification model for dataset that hold several specifications of 2000 mobile phones attempt to predict best price ranges by applying either Artificial Neural Network or by using various machine learning algorithm.
# Notebooks:
Included in this github are a jupyter notebookscontaining:

EDA_DataPreprocessing_Mobile_Price_Classification.ipynb :A notebook where significant EDA to explore the variables as well as data preprocessing steps are performed.

#Main steps performed for EDA and data-preprocessing

1.	Check the null values in dataset
2. Checking number of categorical attributes
3. Finding Duplicates in the data
4. Visualising the data distribution of the target variable
5. Analysing the relationship between variables
6. Analysing the relationship between target variable and other features in dataset
7. Visualising all the input features
8. Detecting Outliers
9. Visualising outliers using box plots

#Data-preprocessing

1. Visualise data in 2-D using LDA
2. Finding the number of outliers and eliminating them
3. Splitting the train and test dataset
4. Standardizing the dataset
